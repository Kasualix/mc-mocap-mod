Then, add your recording using \"/mocap scenes addTo <scene_name> <recording_name> [delay] [x_offset] [y_offset] [z_offset] [player_name]\" (you can skip arguments in square brackets if you want).\n- To play scene use \"/mocap playing start .<scene_name>\" - you need to put a dot before the scene name.\n- By putting a dot before name, when using \"/mocap scenes addTo ...\", you can also add scenes to other scenes.",
